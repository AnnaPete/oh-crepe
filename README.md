## Abstract
As a team of two, we created a movie review site utilizing an API that presented us with a collection of movies and their details. The user is able to scroll through the list of movies displayed in a tile format, when the user clicks on an individual tile, they are taken to a seperate page where they can view expanded movie details, including the movie's rating, release date, revenue, and other details. This project took place in the third inning of Turing's front-end software engineering program, and we were required to utilize and develop new skills in React to create a fully functioning and intuitive site from conception to operation in just under two weeks. A project board was created and user stories were added to guide our development and ensure we had the time and knowledge to complete this application.
